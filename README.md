hilary.js
=========

Hilary is an easy to use JavaScript Inversion of Control (IoC) container written for [Node.js](https://github.com/losandes/hilaryjs/blob/master/README.md#creating-your-first-node-app-with-hilary) and the [browser](https://github.com/losandes/hilaryjs/blob/master/README.md#creating-your-first-browser-app-with-hilary).  Hilary's aim is to deliver low-ceremony dependency injection (DI), to aid in decoupling JavaScript modules and testing.  It's named after Hilary Page, who designed building blocks that later became known as Legos.
